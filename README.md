<b>Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?</b></br>
Artemis Financial is an independent wealth management firm that focuses on serving private clients with all financial needs. Aside from traditional financial portfolios, they offer sustainable investment options including insurance, investments, savings, and retirement. 

<b>What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely?</b></br> 
In this report, all dependency vulnerabilites were researced to eliminate false positives and to find the most up to date solutions.

<b>What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?</b></br>
Software security not only keeps the assets of the business safe, but it also brings additional value to the business as a reliable and trustworthy organization for its customers.

<b>What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?</b></br>
The most challenging and helpful part of this assessment was researching every vulnerability. The national database pulls from variety of third party sites with different formats and language. Interpreting these accuratly was time consuming, but also helped teach me how to navigate these different resources.

<b>How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?</b></br>
In the manual review, it was determined additional input validation and encryption were needed for secure access control.

<b>How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?</b></br>
This happened in the final project. After refactoring the code, I activly ran the AES encryption to ensure that the keys were worked, I ensured the code was error free, and I updated in libraries that were on the vulnerability assessment that weren't false positives.

<b>What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?</b></br>
Whether I work in security or not, I have learned the importance of incorporating security at every phase of the software development life cycle.

<b>Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?</b></br>
I believe they will see an orgainzed, clearly written report where every consideration was made for every security concern.
